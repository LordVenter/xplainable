**Xplainable** leverages explainable machine learning for fully transparent predictions and advanced data optimisation in production systems.
</div>


## Installation

You can install the core features of ``xplainable`` with:

```
pip install xplainable
```

to use the ``xplainable`` gui in a jupyter notebook, install with:

```
pip install xplainable[gui]
```

Vist our [Documentation](https://xplainable.readthedocs.io) for additional
support.

## Getting Started

**Basic Example**

```python
import xplainable as xp
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

# Load data
data = pd.read_csv('data.csv')
train, test = train_test_split(data, test_size=0.2)

# Train a model
model = xp.classifier(train)
```

## Why Was Xplainable Created?
In machine learning, there has long been a trade-off between accuracy and 
explainability. This drawback has led to the creation of explainable ML
libraries such as [Shap](https://github.com/slundberg/shap) and [Lime](https://github.com/marcotcr/lime) which make estimations of model decision processes. These can be incredibly time-expensive and often present steep
learning curves making them challenging to implement effectively in production
environments.

To solve this problem, we created ``xplainable``. **xplainable** presents a
suite of novel machine learning algorithms specifically designed to match the
performance of popular black box models like [XGBoost](https://github.com/dmlc/xgboost) and [LightGBM](https://github.com/microsoft/LightGBM) while
providing complete transparency, all in real-time.

## Simple Interface
You can interface with xplainable either through a typical Pythonic API, or
using a notebook-embedded GUI in your Jupyter Notebook.

## Models
Xplainable has each of the fundamental tabular models used in data science
teams. They are fast, accurate, and easy to use.

<div align="center">

| Model | Python API| Jupyter GUI |
|:-----:|:---------:|:-----------:|
| Regression | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ |
| Binary Classification | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ |
| Multi-Class Classification | ‚úÖ | üîú |
</div>

## Features
Xplainable helps to streamline development processes by making model tuning
and deployment simpler than you can imagine.

### Preprocessing
We built a comprehensive suite of preprocessing transformers for rapid and
reproducible data preprocessing.

<div align="center">

| Feature | Python API| Jupyter GUI |
|:------|:------:|:------:|
| Data Health Checks | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ |
| Transformers Library | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ |
| Preprocessing Pipelines | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ |
| Pipeline Persistance | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ |
</div>

#### Using the GUI

```python
pp = xp.Preprocessor()

pp.preprocess(train)
```
<div align="center">

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/xplainable/xplainable/main/docs/assets/gifs/preprocessing.gif">

</div><br>

#### Using the API
```python
from xplainable.preprocessing.pipeline import XPipeline
from xplainable.preprocessing import transformers as xtf

pipeline = XPipeline()

# Add stages for specific features
pipeline.add_stages([
    {"feature": "age", "transformer": xtf.Clip(lower=18, upper=99)},
    {"feature": "balance", "transformer": xtf.LogTransform()}
])

# add stages on multiple features
pipeline.add_stages([
    {"transformer": xtf.FillMissing({'job': 'mode', 'age': 'mean'})},
    {"transformer": xtf.DropCols(columns=['duration', 'campaign'])}
])

# Fit and transform the data
train_transformed = pipeline.fit_transform(train)

# Apply transformations on new data
test_transformed = pipeline.transform(test)

```


### Modelling

Xplainable models can be developed, optimised, and re-optimised using Pythonic
APIs or the embedded GUI.

<div align="center">

| Feature | Python API| Jupyter GUI |
|:------|:------:|:------:|
| Classic Vanilla Data Science APIs | ‚úÖ | - |
| AutoML | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ |
| Hyperparameter Optimisation | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ |
| Partitioned Models | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ |
| **Rapid Refitting** (novel to xplainable) | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ |
| Model Persistance | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ |

</div>

#### Using the GUI

```python
model = xp.classifier(train)
```
<div align="center">
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/xplainable/xplainable/main/docs/assets/gifs/gui_classifier.gif">
</div><br>

#### Using the API
```python
from xplainable.core.models import XClassifier
from xplainable.core.optimisation.bayesian import XParamOptimiser
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
import pandas as pd

# Load your data
data = pd.read_csv('data.csv')
x, y = data.drop('target', axis=1), data['target']
X_train, x_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(x, y, test_size=0.2)

# Optimise params
opt = XParamOptimiser(metric='roc-auc')
params = opt.optimise(X_train, y_train)

# Train your model
model = XClassifier(**params)
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Predict on the test set
y_pred = model.predict(x_test)
```

#### Using the GUI

### Rapid Refitting
Fine tune your models by refitting model parameters on the fly, even on
individual features.

<div align="center">
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/xplainable/xplainable/main/docs/assets/gifs/recalibrate.gif">
</div><br>

#### Using the API
```python
new_params = {
            "features": ['Age'],
            "max_depth": 6,
            "min_info_gain": 0.01,
            "min_leaf_size": 0.03,
            "weight": 0.05,
            "power_degree": 1,
            "sigmoid_exponent": 1,
            "x": X_train,
            "y": y_train
}

model.update_feature_params(**new_params)
```

### Explainability
Models are explainable and real-time, right out of the box, without having to fit
surrogate models such as [Shap](https://github.com/slundberg/shap) or[Lime](https://github.com/marcotcr/lime).

<div align="center">

| Feature | Python API| Jupyter GUI |
|:------|:------:|:------:|

</div>

```python
model.explain()
```

### #FairML
We promote fair and ethical use of technology for all machine learning tasks.
To help encourage this, we're working on additional bias detection and fairness
testing classes to ensure that everything you deploy is safe, fair, and
compliant.
